This application on Steam, Quest, Oculus and Lynx are laboratories with XR and mixed reality. 
It is shape as some open source mini game sample under Unity3D that you can play then learn from.  

My name is Éloi Strée, I am a game developer since Oculus DK1.   
With the Quest 3 and the Lynx R1, I decided to relearn what is VR through AR lens for the years 2024-2026.   

My life is made of experiments about curiosity and code.   

It is build in the context of the "Learn 2 Play" and "Open Macro Input XR" projects.  
( More on that here: [http://eloistree.github.io/r/learnxr](http://eloistree.github.io/r/learnxr) )  

The game is opensource but will be at 20€ in a near future to allows me to live from this project.  
You can also access it at all time on my drive by being a sponsor of my work:

May the code be with you,  
Eloi
