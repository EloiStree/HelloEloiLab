# Hello Eloi XR Lab

This application on Steam, Quest, Oculus and Lynx are laboratories with XR.
It is shape as some open source games under Unity3D that you can play then learn from.

My name is Éloi Strée, I am a game developer since Oculus DK1.  
With the Quest 3 and the Lynx R1, I decided to relearn what is VR through AR lens for the years 2024-2026.   

My life is made of experiments about curiosity and code.  

It is build in the context of the "Learn 2 Play" and "Open Macro Input XR" projects.
( More on that here: eloistree.github.io/r/learnxr )

It is a new project start the 13 October 2023 that is design to be construct in parallels of workshop in real life.
Feel free to follows the project or to have talks with me on Discord.

May the code be with you,
Eloi
